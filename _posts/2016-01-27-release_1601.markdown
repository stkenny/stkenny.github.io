Release 16.01 of the repository software has been tagged and deployed to the production system.
For this release some changes were made to how an object is edited. It should now be easier to manage
the organisations attached to a collection. Also access controls and licences can now be modified
separately from the metadata.

Changes include: 

- updated [Hydra][hydra], [sufia-models][sufia-models]  and [Blacklight][blacklight] versions
- Rails updated to latest to include [security updates][rails-security]
- some styling changes
- improved validation of metadata entry forms
- only display user's collections in their profile
- changes to views for editing objects
