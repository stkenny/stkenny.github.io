I've been looking at creating RDF from the XML metadata of a DRI collection. Part of this involves using OpenRefine to reconcile the metadata with other datasets, mainly dbpedia. I also wanted to add links to LCSH subjects, but was unable to find an available endpoint to use as a reconciliation service. Instead I created a local SPARQL endpoint using Apache Jena Fuseki. The following gives the steps I followed to do this.

Download Apache Jena Fuseki server from <https://jena.apache.org/download/index.cgi>.

Extract the download:

```
tar -zxvf apache-jena-fuseki-2.3.1.tar.gz
```

```
cd apache-jena-fuseki-2.3.1
```

The simplest way I found to create a new dataset is to start the server and use the UI.

```
./fuseki-server
```

The server should be available at the default port of 3030 <http://localhost:3030>. The 'Manage datasets' tab allows for a new dataset to be added.

A directory will be created for the new dataset ```run/databases/lcsh```. The next stage is to load the LCSH data.

The LCSH datasets can be found at <http://id.loc.gov/download/> in various formats. I used the LC Subject Headings (SKOS/RDF) in RDF/XML, although N-triples should work also. Once downloaded and extracted the dataset can be loaded with the following command:

```
java -cp fuseki-server.jar tdb.tdbloader --loc run/databases/lcsh subjects-skos-20140306.rdf
```

The endpoint should now be ready to use in OpenRefine. A new RDF reconciliation service is added using the address of the local Fuseki instance.

Now a column can be reconciled using this service. As an example the value "Easter Rising 1916" can be matched to [Ireland--History--Easter Rising](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85068025.html).
