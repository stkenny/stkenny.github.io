A new release of the repository software, the first since launch, has been deployed to the production system. This release includes: 

- upgraded [Hydra][hydra], [ActiveFedora][active-fedora], [sufia-models][sufia-models] versions
- changed workflow for managing organisations
- editor's can remove draft objects and individual assets attached to draft objects
- completed DOI implementation

Completing the [DOI][datacite-doi] functionality means we can now begin the process of minting DOIs for the collections currently published in the repository. Initially this will be done on a collection by collection basis. Collections ingested in the future will be assigned DOIs at time of publication.

You can access the repository at <https://repository.dri.ie>.
