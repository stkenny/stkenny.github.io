Release 16.07 of the repository software has been deployed to the production system. It was a bit of a
struggle to get this one out, mostly due to an Ansible update on the deployment machines. Upgrading to 
Ansible 2 caused quite a few problems with our multi-stage setup (i.e., deploying to test and production).
There were also issues related to the [XML editor](rails/javascript/2016/08/07/xml_editor/) in the production 
vs development environment.

Changes include: 

- Rails updated to latest to include important [security updates][rails-security]
- XML editor for MODS and MARC metadata
- Allow depositor to see status of potentially long running background jobs (e.g. when publishing a collection)
- Added [Honeybadger][honeybadger] application monitoring
